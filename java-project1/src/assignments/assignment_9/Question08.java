		 * Question-8

Alejandro have started learning java, he knows what you know about ifs and strings. 
He has a large number of text emails, going through all of them will take a lot of time. 
To save time he will only read the emails that refer to him by name. He wants to write a program 
that gets a string (the email) and determines if his name "Alejandro" appears in that string. 
if so it will output "read this mail" else it will output "don't read".

Sample Output:

     input: "dear alejandro.....alot of text"

     output: "read this mail"

     input: "thunder blaz is the best drink in the galaxy..."

     output: "don't read"

     input: "subject: important project, Alejandro we refer to you this ...."

     output: "read this mail"*/
		
		isReadable("dear alejandro.....alot of text");
		isReadable("thunder blaz is the best drink in the galaxy...");
		isReadable("subject: important project, Alejandro we refer to you this ....");
	}
	
	
	public static void isReadable(String mail) {
		if (mail.toLowerCase().contains("alejandro")) {
			System.out.println("read this mail");
		}else {
			System.out.println("don't read");
		}
	}

}
