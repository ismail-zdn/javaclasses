What is Abstraction
◦ A concept that focuses only on the feature / idea of something and
not how it is done (implementation)
◦ In java, abstraction is achieved via abstract class or interface
◦ Abstraction cannot exist without inheritance

*****

What is an Abstract class?
- Add keyword abstract before the class declaration
- An abstract class cannot be instantiated – An object can never be created
from that class
- An abstract class allows creation of abstract methods, which are methods
without any implementation. In other words, methods without a body. 
- The class which inherits the abstract class is called the concrete class. The
concrete class must implement all abstract methods declared from the
abstract class
- Variables act following regular inheritance rules

****

Extend an abstract class to another
abstract class:

◦ It’s possible for an abstract class to inherit another abstract class. In this
case implementation of the abstract methods are not required 
◦ In this case the sub abstract class is not a concrete class, but as soon as a
concrete class inherits all the properties of that abstract class it must implement
all abstract methods from all super classes

*****

Abstract Class Rules Recap

◦ Abstract classes can not be instantiated (can not create as a object with new keyword)
◦ Abstract classes may be defined with any number of abstract and non-abstract methods, 
including none
◦ Abstract classes can not be private or final
◦ An abstract class that extends another abstract class inherits all its abstract
methods as its own abstract methods
◦ The first concrete class that extends an abstract class must provide an
implementation for all the inherited abstract methods
