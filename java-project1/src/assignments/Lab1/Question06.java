		 * Question-6

When chipmonks get together for a party, they like to have cigars. 
A chipmonk party is successfull when the number of cigars is between 40 and 60. 
Unless it is the weekend, in which case there is no upper bound on the number of cigars. 
Write a method that accepts number of cigars and a boolean for weekend, and prints true 
if the party with the given values is successful, or false otherwise.

cigarParty(30, false) → false
cigarParty(50, false) → true
cigarParty(70, true) → true*/
		
		cigarParty(30, false);
		cigarParty(50, false);
		cigarParty(70, true);

			System.out.println("true");
		}else {
			if (number>40 && number<60) {
